## Evolution Overview

The first evolution focused on **rapid prototyping** and getting a working application up quickly. This single-file approach taught the fundamentals of web development while keeping complexity minimal.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Rapid Development**: Getting from idea to working application quickly
- **Full-Stack Fundamentals**: Understanding the complete web development stack
- **Database Design**: Learning SQLAlchemy and database relationships
- **User Interface**: Creating functional web interfaces with embedded templates

### [Building a Full-Stack Property Management App: Single File Version](/learning/full-stack-development/python/tenant-management-app-singlefile/)

**Date**: September 1, 2025  
**Focus**: Single-file architecture, rapid prototyping, embedded templates  
**Key Learnings**: Flask fundamentals, SQLAlchemy ORM, database design, template rendering

## Technical Achievements

- ✅ Complete CRUD operations for properties, tenants, and transactions
- ✅ SQLAlchemy ORM with proper relationships
- ✅ Embedded HTML templates with Bootstrap styling
- ✅ Form handling and validation
- ✅ Database migrations and seed data

## Architecture Highlights

- **Single File**: All logic contained in one Python file
- **Embedded Templates**: HTML templates embedded as strings
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Object-relational mapping for database operations
- **Bootstrap UI**: Responsive interface with Bootstrap CSS framework

## Key Learnings

1. **Rapid Prototyping Value**: Single-file approach enabled quick iteration
2. **Full-Stack Understanding**: Learned how all layers work together
3. **Database Relationships**: Mastered one-to-many and many-to-many relationships
4. **User Experience**: Focused on creating functional, user-friendly interfaces
5. **Development Speed**: Appreciated the speed of single-file development

## Evolution Outcomes

This evolution successfully demonstrated that a functional application could be built quickly with minimal complexity. It provided the foundation for understanding the domain and identifying areas for improvement in subsequent evolutions.

The single-file approach, while not scalable, taught valuable lessons about rapid development and the importance of getting working software in users' hands quickly.
