**Content Requirements:**
- Browse http://localhost:3000 to access splitwise-ai-app project
- It has two ways to manage expense details from users
- Manual and Chat interface based - add few users (4 - 5), Add random expenses for food, travel etc. for past few months - around 10 expenses shared between different users
- Post is in relation to how business should consider introducting AI to their existing applications
- Explain how the applications exists today (manual) and only way for users is to follow the defined rules and UI
- Explain how AI can help end users by giving text and voice based managing application functionality making it easy to access application without going through UI functions and just managing applicaiton features using text or voice chat
- Idea is to explain that there are all types of customers, some understand AI features, some don't. So just replacing with new AI feature may be problematic for existing users who are familiar with existing UI based functions. At the same time, we provide new AI based feature in parallel promoting users to utilise new feature. It promotes introducing new technology in phased manner and making a perfect roadmap of introducing AI technology to users. Just replacing may not go well and users may not like it - so this approach could be the best way how organisations should enhance the applications. 
- Take useful screenshots of how manual interface works and help users and then use chat interfact to perform similar actions and use those to explain the concept of AI roadmap 
- Explain more around this concept and hightlighting introducting helps users with flexibile AI feature set at the same time allowing existing manual interfaces to run in parallel
